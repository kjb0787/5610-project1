      <h4>
        Seals, also known as pinnipeds, make up three diverse groups of semi-aquatic carnivorous marine mammals.
        Constituting the most species-rich clade of living marine mammals, there are 33 types of seals widely
        distributed around the world, dating back to the late Oligocene (27-25 million years ago) period according
        to fossil records, with more than 50 species existing at one point in time.

        The three subclades of pinniped include Phocidae, or true seals, Otariidae, or fur
        seals and sea lions, and Odobenidae, with only one remaining species, the walrus. The earliest
        pinnipeds were aquatic carnivores with well-developed, paddle-shaped limbs and feet, and likely
        went through a freshwater-dwelling phase during their transition from land-living to spending the
        bulk of their time in the ocean.

      <h2>1. Seals Are Related to Bears, Skunks, and Badgers</h2>
      <h4>Evolutionary biologists have been arguing over seals' origins for more than a century. While relatively
        sure
        that pinnipeds evolved from land-dwelling carnivores, scientists are divided on the precise steps that
        occurred
        between terrestrial ancestors and modern marine mammals. Along with the three subclades of pinniped, the
        suborder Caniformia contains Ursidae (bears), Mustelidae (badgers, otters, weasels, and relatives), and
        Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers).3﻿﻿ In 2007, a nearly complete skeleton of a new semi-aquatic
        carnivore
        from an early Miocene lake deposit in Nunavut, Canada, was discovered and became known as an evolutionary
        link
        between land mammals and seals.

      <h2>2. "Earless" True Seals Actually Do Have Ears</h2>
      <h4>
        Seals' ability to hear can vary between species. "Earless" seals lack an external ear flap, present on fur
        seals
        and sea lions, but they still have ears present beneath the surface of the skin. True seals (phocids) hear
        higher frequencies under water than otariids (fur seals and sea lions), and the opposite is true for
        airborne
        sounds. All pinnipeds are more sensitive to underwater sounds than they are to airborne sounds.

      <h2>3. Mothers and Pups Bond With a Unique Call</h2>
      <h4>
        Researchers performed vocalization playback experiments on 18 breeding female harbor seals to assess their
        abilities to recognize calls of their pup and to evaluate the effect of maternal protectiveness. They found
        that mothers were more responsive to the calls of their own pup than to non-filial pups after only three days.
        Mother seals' responses also varied depending on their protective behavior displayed towards their pup. And
        species of seals in which the young are more mobile and the colonies are more dense are more likely to
        strongly develop vocal recognition abilities

      <h2>4. The Largest Seal Weighs More Than Four Tons</h2>
      <h4>
        A male southern elephant seal has an average weight of 8,000 pounds while females are much smaller.5﻿ This
        drastically contrasts the smallest seal in the family of otariids, the Galapagos fur seal, which ranges
        between 60 to 140 pounds on average.6﻿ Almost all seals, with the exception of the nearly-hairless walrus, are
        covered in thick fur, and have layers of fat to keep them warm called blubber.
